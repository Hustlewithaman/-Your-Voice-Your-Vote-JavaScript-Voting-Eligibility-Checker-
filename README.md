 🔹 “Your Voice, Your Vote” – JavaScript Voting Eligibility Checker

I’m passionate about building intuitive and meaningful user‑centric web experiences. My latest project, “Your Voice, Your Vote”, is a sleek, mobile‑friendly voting eligibility checker built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. With this project, my aim was to translate a simple yet powerful user need—checking voting eligibility based on age—into a polished, fully interactive application.

🎯 What I Built:

A clean, responsive interface featuring a background image, voting‑themed header, and an eye‑catching card layout.

A numeric input for age and a “Check” button tied to JavaScript logic.

Real‑time feedback that validates user input, then displays context‑aware messages: “✅ Eligible to vote,” “❌ Not eligible,” or “⚠️ Please enter a valid age.”

🌟 Why It Matters:

User‑Focused Design: I emphasized usability—clear visual cues, immediate feedback, and validation—ensuring accessibility and inclusivity.

Web Basics Mastery: Even without frameworks, the app showcases practical skills: DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and styling.

Scalable Foundation: This core could evolve into a larger civic‑tech tool—logging past entries, saving preferences, or integrating external APIs for real‑time demographic data.

📈 What I Learned:

Clean separation of HTML structure, CSS styling, and JS logic improves maintainability.

DOM queries (getElementById, event listeners) are powerful tools for dynamic UI updates.

Simple validation creates a safer and more trustworthy user experience.

🔗 Next Steps:
I’m now planning to enhance the tool by enabling keyboard interaction (pressing Enter to submit), accessible ARIA labels, and personalized feedback models
